肯定还有什么问题，我身上难以抵抗的劣根，导致我生活悲惨个性扭曲性格丑陋欲望强盛的根本性问题，摧毁我的高中，摧毁我半数的人生，慢性毒杀自己的什么问题

越关键就越会失败
压力越大就越会失败
越担心就越会发生
越逃避就越会出问题
越侥幸就越会完蛋

除了骂自己傻逼之外肯定有什么方法，肯定可以短暂的或是永久的战胜这些问题，无论如何不要逃避，不要像个懦夫一样一辈子靠运气和安慰活着。

There must still be something profoundly wrong with me—a despicable flaw so deeply ingrained that I am powerless against it. It is this flaw that has condemned me to a life of misery, warped my personality, twisted my character, and filled me with disgusting desires. It destroyed my high school years, shattered half of my life, and continues to slowly poison me from within.

The more important something is, the more I am doomed to fail.
The greater the pressure, the more inevitable my failure becomes.
The more I fear something, the more it will come true.
The more I try to avoid something, the worse it becomes.
The more I hope for luck, the more everything falls apart.

I can’t believe that cursing myself as a fool is the only answer. There has to be something—anything—that can help me conquer these problems, even if only briefly. I cannot keep running away. I cannot spend my life as a coward, pathetically clinging to luck and false comfort, pretending it’s enough to survive.
